## Documentation

The best way to find out what's available is to check out the [documentation site](), but if you like digging through source code, then each directory has a README file to describe each feature.

## Changelog

This project uses a [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md), which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. [Read more about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## How to Contribute

Looking to help out?  There are numerous ways to support this project and they are all detailed within our [CONTRIBUTING](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) doc.

## How We Version

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for our versioning providing us an opt-in approach to releases. This means we add a version number according to the spec, as you see below. So rather than force developers to consume the latest and greatest, they can choose which version to consume and test any newer ones before upgrading. Please the read the spec as it goes into further detail.

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

* **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
* **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
* **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
